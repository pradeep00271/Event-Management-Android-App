    About:
</h3>
<br>
there is a strong need for women to take up greater responsibilities and equip themselves with the knowledge of stress
management and learn to face the world with courage and passion. out of the 40% of women present in our college only 10% participate in non college
activities. in olden days, women did not get to make many of their own choices and majority of time their life was only
mapped out for them prior to adulthood. now by given a chance or taking advantage of the struggles made by the women in yester years
they still break their necks to reach their goals.noticing that the women of our college need adequate emotional support and the need to handle problems
without taking hasty decisions the idea of girls's forum emanated.this is the official girls forum of CEG.
